# Canvas File Sync

When using Canvas, I found that constantly downloading new files, updated files and then organizing those files was a huge pain. This program aims to work by having Google Drive like functionality with Canvas so that you never have to worry about being up to date or how you have organized things, because they will be organized on your computer just as they are organized on Canvas.
